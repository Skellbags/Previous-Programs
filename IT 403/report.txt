1)De Facto Standards(Flexible) is defined as the widely excepted rules of creating a method or
product. For instance, HTML is de facto, because almost all websites are comprised of and use
HTML. They don't have to be, but because HTML is userfriendly and easy to learn, It has
become the publicly accepted markup language. 

2)De Jure Standards(Non-flexible) is defined as the established method or product that has to
be used or operated in a specific way. For instance, TCP/IP is the de jure protocol that is used
to govern over all computers that connect to the Internet. All computers that can connect to the 
internet have to use TCP/IP, because it is how the internet is run, and there is no other.
 
3)I chose The World Wide Web Consortium for the standards body. The W3C is an international
organization that develops Web standards. It is lead and run by Tim Berners-Lee, The inventor
of the internet. To be able to join as a paid staff member, you have to commit W3C 
80% of your time for a typical period of 18-24 months, as well as "possess insight, tact, technical
understanding, and the ability to follow things through". Also you have to be able to fluently
read, write, and speak English. W3C does have some leverage over most of internet due to the
credibility of its director, Tim Berners-Lee. Since he is the father of the internet, and has had the
longest relationship with the internet, most believe that he is the most knowlegeble on the
matter.

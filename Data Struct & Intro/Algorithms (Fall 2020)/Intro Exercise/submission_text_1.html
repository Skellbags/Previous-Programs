<p>I don’t believe you answered this in the class, however, you did make a suggestion of it. In the “Beginning-of-semester seating arrangement” survey, you made the choice of either learning online all semester or learning in class. In contrast, with labs, you expressed that with the classes acquisition of the skills, we have the option to progressively work on the labs online. Will the lectures closer to the closing of the semester have the same strategy to minimize our TA’s exposure? I also may not have fully understood what was expressed on the matter and I’m just seeking further clarification. I’m looking forward to this semester and everything CS515 has to offer!!</p>

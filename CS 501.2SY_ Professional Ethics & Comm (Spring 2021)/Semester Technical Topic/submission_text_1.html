<p>Hello Prof. MacAuslan,</p>
<p>I am planning on educating the class using the recent advances in SpaceX, the American aerospace manufacturer that is paving the way for future interplanetary travel. The goal of SpaceX is to reduce the cost of space travel in the hope to colonize Mars and other planets. One example of how they're trying to better the human species is by the release of Starlink, which is an experimental plan for global internet access by 2022. They are making great advances in space technology which you don't hear a lot of nowadays and that is the reason why I think it'd be lucrative to inform the class on such an interesting topic.</p>

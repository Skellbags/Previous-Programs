<p>1.) For both java and c++, you need object files to run the code. This breaks down the source code into files more readable/manageable for the computer. With python, this isn't required because the computer handles this automatically(and doesn't need to create an object file to do so).</p>
<p>2.) Because usually, you execute a compiler, which has its own command list. Using something like javac ____ creates the object file. All compiler/transpilers exist as standalone programs and run the code themselves because the object code isn't executable by the computer's CLI.</p>

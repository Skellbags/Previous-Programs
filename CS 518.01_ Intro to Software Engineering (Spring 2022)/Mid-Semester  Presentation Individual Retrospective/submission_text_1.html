<p>I think our team did well on our presentation, We communicated effectively, introduced new information to the class while still staying on topic about what we learned in class. We also were able to deal with Ramya's virtual issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We could have improved by coming up with some sort of script to more accurately reach time. Also, we could have chosen a more interesting theme.</p>
<p>Everyone one worked on all parts of our presentation. I though that Vserver/Vcenter/Vsphere were a good topic, and I had already had some amount of background information on it. I think the entire class's presentations went well!</p>

<p>The topic we chose is VMware vCenter Server. We are planning to divide our presentation into a few talking points: who uses it, what it's used for, and why it's used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assignment:</p>
<p>Riley: What it's used for</p>
<p>Ramya: Who uses it</p>
<p>Ryan: Why it's used</p>
<p>Today, we chose our topic, divided our topic into assignments, and started working on creating our presentation.</p>

<p>As shown by the report, Function1 requires much more Computer memory because in the code, it shown that the difference between f1 and f2 is that f1 does addition row by column which f2 does addition column by row. Function1 takes more resources because the values in the array aren't saved contiguously in memory vs the other function which does save them for later use</p>

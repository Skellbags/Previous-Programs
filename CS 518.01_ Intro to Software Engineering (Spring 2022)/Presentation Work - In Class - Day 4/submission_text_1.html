<p><strong>What you did?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ryan split up more of the "How" slides to make the presentation more cohesive and added more information about CI/CD.</li>
<li>Ramya added speaker notes to his "What" slide to better prepare what he will say next time when we rehearse our presentation.</li>
<li>Riley split up the "Why" slides and added speaker notes after researching more about Kubernetes and AWS.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What needs to happen?</strong></p>
<p>We still need to record and rehearse our presentation to get a better idea of timing.</p>
<p><strong>What is blocking or a problem?</strong></p>
<p>We haven't encountered any problems so far.</p>
<p><strong>Who specifically has/is doing what?</strong></p>
<p>Ramya has been working on developing speaker notes for "What" slides, and Ryan and Riley have been mostly doing the same for "How" and "Why".</p>

'''
Here is a bit of code to get you started.

Notice that I have created functions, which do one thing.
Using functions in this way lets you write a main program that
provides over-all structure, BEFORE you create the functioning pieces
of your code.
'''

    Create and return a single string, using the words in sys.argv
    Method: use " ".join(some list)
    '''

    '''
    Open the file, and go through its lines.

    Repeat this:
       read one line: it's the character
       read 7 lines: they make up the block
       put the 7 lines in a list
       store the list in blocks, keyed by character.
    '''

    blocks = dict()
    # your code goes here

    # Return all 95 blocks in the file.

def get_text_height(text):
    '''
    Figure out how many lines your text takes up
    You have 13 letters per line, so "Hello World"
    takes 1 line:
    1234567890123
    Hello World

    But "Hello World how are you" takes 2:
    1234567890123
    Hello World h
